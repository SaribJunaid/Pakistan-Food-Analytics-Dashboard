# Pakistan-Food-Analytics-Dashboard
An end-to-end data project analyzing real-time food trends in five major cities of Pakistan using web scraping, data cleaning, SQL analysis, and Power BI.

Problem Statement
Foodies and vloggers often struggle to discover which restaurants are most popular among locals in different cities. Existing reviews are scattered or paywalled. This project solves that by collecting and analyzing actual food data from Foodpanda to highlight top-rated and most-reviewed restaurants by city and dish.

Tech Stack
Python + Selenium: For real-time web scraping
Pandas + Jupyter Notebook: For data cleaning and preprocessing
SQL Server (SSMS): For storing and querying cleaned data
Power BI: For dashboard creation and storytelling

Covered Cities & Dishes
Karachi â€“ Biryani, Nihari
Lahore â€“ BBQ, Karahi
Peshawar â€“ Chapli Kebab
Islamabad â€“ Burgers
Quetta â€“ Sajji
